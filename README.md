OOJS Arcade Game: "Frogger"
===============================
<h2>Description</h2>
Developed a performant, organized and easily maintainable version of the classic arcade game, Frogger. Added some additional functions to the basic functionality.<br>
Broken the application down into simpler entities that manage their own properties and functionality.<br>
Coded app.js to build reusable and maintainable libraries for player, enemy, star and other game entities with JavaScript's object-oriented pseudo-classical pattern.<br>
Coded engine.js to provide the game loop and resources.js to load and cache all images the game needed.

<h2>Game Aim</h2>
